Few studies have examined associations between neighborhood socioeconomic contexts and smoking and alcohol use while also accounting for differences in family and peer risk factors for substance use. Data drawn from the Seattle Social Development Project (N = 808), a gender-balanced (female = 49%), multiethnic, theory-driven longitudinal study originating in Seattle, WA, were used to estimate trajectories of smoking and alcohol use from 5th to 9th grade. Time-varying measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, family, and peer factors were associated with smoking and alcohol use at each wave after accounting for average growth in smoking and alcohol use over time and demographic differences. Results indicated that living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, lower family income, lower family general functioning, more permissive family smoking environments, and affiliation with deviant peers were independently associated with increased smoking. Lower family functioning, more permissive family alcohol use environments, and deviant peers were independently associated with increased alcohol use. The effect of neighborhood disadvantage on smoking was mediated by family income and deviant peers while the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on alcohol use was mediated by deviant peers alone. Family functioning and family substance use did not mediate associations between neighborhood disadvantage and smoking or alcohol use. The results highlight the importance of neighborhood, family, and peer factors in early adolescent smoking and alcohol use. Future studies should examine the unique association of neighborhood disadvantage with adolescent smoking net of family socioeconomics, functioning, and substance use, as well as peer affiliations. Better understanding of the role of contextual factors in early adolescent smoking and alcohol use can help bolster efforts to prevent both short and long harms from substance use.},

Studies directly assessing the control of outlet density as a means of controlling excessive alcohol consumption and related harms do not exist, but assessments of related phenomena are indicative. To assess the effects of outlet density on alcohol-related harms, primary evidence was used from interrupted time–series studies of outlet density
studies of the privatization of alcohol sales, alcohol bans, and changes in license arrangements—all of which affected outlet density. Most of the studies included in this review found that greater outlet density is associated with increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including medical harms, injury, crime, and violence. Primary evidence was supported by secondary evidence from correlational studies. The regulation of alcohol outlet density may be a useful public health tool for the reduction of excessive alcohol consumption and related harms.},

   abstract = {Purpose This paper describes the origins and application of a theory, the social development model (SDM), that seeks to explain causal processes that lead to the development of prosocial and problem behaviors. The SDM was used to guide the development of a multicomponent intervention in middle childhood called Raising Healthy Children (RHC) that seeks to promote prosocial development and prevent problem behaviors. This paper reviews and integrates the tests of the SDM and the impact of RHC. While the original results of both model and intervention tests have been published elsewhere, this paper provides a comprehensive review of these tests. As such, this integrative paper provides one of the few examples of the power of theory-driven developmental preventive intervention to understand impact across generations and the power of embedding controlled tests of preventive intervention within longitudinal studies to understand causal mechanisms. Methods Application of the SDM in the RHC intervention was tested in a quasi-experimental trial nested in the Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP). SSDP is a longitudinal study of 808 students who attended 18 public schools in Seattle, WA, and whose parents consented for their participation in longitudinal research when they were in grade 5 (77% of the eligible population in participating schools). Students assented at each survey administration and consented to longitudinal follow-up when they turned 18. Panel subjects were followed and surveyed 15 times from grade 5 through age 39, with most completion rates above 90%. Results We describe effects of the full multicomponent RHC intervention delivered in grades 1 through 6 by comparing outcomes of those children assigned to the full RHC intervention condition to controls from middle childhood through age 39. We also report the effects of the full RHC intervention on the firstborn children of participants compared with the firstborn children of controls. Conclusions We discuss the use of the theory to guide the development and testing of preventive interventions and the utility of nesting intervention tests within longitudinal studies for testing both theory and interventions.},

METHOD: Data were obtained from a community sample (N=5,856) of lifetime drinkers participating in the 1990-1991 Mental Health Supplement of the Ontario Health Survey.RESULTS: Survival analyses revealed a rapid progression to alcohol-related harm among those who reported having their first drink at ages 11-14. After 10 years, 13.5% of the subjects who began to drink at ages 11 and 12 met the criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, and 15.9% had a diagnosis of dependence. Rates for subjects who began to drink at ages 13 and 14 were 13.7% and 9.0%, respectively. In contrast, rates for those who started drinking at ages 19 and older were 2.0% and 1.0%. Unexpectedly, a delay in progression to harm was observed for the youngest drinkers (ages 10 and under). Hazard regression analyses revealed a nonlinear effect of age at first alcohol use, marked by an elevated risk of developing disorders among subjects first using alcohol at ages 11-14. CONCLUSIONS: First use of alcohol at ages 11-14 greatly heightens the risk of progression to the development of alcohol disorders and therefore is a reasonable target for intervention strategies that seek to delay first use as a means of averting problems later in life.},

The Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies with case–control design. Articles were selected based on their relevance and presentation of data related to statistical comparisons of at least one or more demographic, psychological, or social maternal risk factors for FASD. 738 references were identified, of which 15 met the criteria to be included in the present review. Mothers of FASD children tend to: be older at the time of birth of the affected child, present lower educational level, have other family relatives with alcohol abuse, have other children with FASD, present a pattern of little prenatal care and a distinguishing pattern of alcohol consumption (alcohol use before and during pregnancy, failure to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy, and frequent episodes of binge drinking). Application of the NOS scale of methodological quality indicated that 8 studies (53 %) met the criterion for selection, 4 (27 %) were suitable for the criterion for comparability and only 4 studies were suitable for the exposition criterion. Mothers of FASD children have a distinctive pattern of drinking and accumulate several social risk factors. Maternal age at birth of the child seems to accentuate the risk. There are, however, few controlled studies that are adequate according to the NOS requirements for methodological quality. Fewer are based on the verification of a theoretical model. Clinicians should be aware of the relevance of preventive assessment of FASD risk mothers.},

the determination that an association is causal indicates the possibility for intervention. We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

Since then the number of publications has increased dramatically. The study reviews the more recent studies with regard to their utility to inform policy. Approach A systematic review found more than 160 relevant studies (published between January 2009 and October 2014). The review focused on: (i) outlet density and assaultive or intimate partner violence
(ii) studies including individual level data
or (iii) ‘natural experiments’. Key Findings Despite overall evidence for an association between density and harm, there is little evidence on causal direction (i.e. whether demand leads to more supply or increased availability increases alcohol use and harm). When outlet types (e.g. bars, supermarkets) are analysed separately, studies are too methodologically diverse and partly contradictory to permit firm conclusions besides those pertaining to high outlet densities in areas such as entertainment districts. Outlet density commonly had little effect on individual‐level alcohol use, and the few ‘natural experiments’ on restricting densities showed little or no effects. Implications and Conclusions Although outlet densities are likely to be positively related to alcohol use and harm, few policy recommendations can be given as effects vary across study areas, outlet types and outlet cluster size. Future studies should examine in detail outlet types, compare different outcomes associated with different strengths of association with alcohol, analyse non‐linear effects and compare different methodologies. Purely aggregate‐level studies examining total outlet density only should be abandoned. [Gmel G, Holmes J, Studer J. Are alcohol outlet densities strongly associated with alcohol‐related outcomes?

   abstract = {Objective: This study examined the association between age at alcohol use onset and adult alcohol misuse and dependence by testing the sensitive-period hypothesis that early adolescence (11-14) is a vulnerable period of development during which initiating alcohol use is particularly harmful. Method: Data came from a longitudinal panel of 808 participants recruited in 1981. Participants were followed through age 33 in 2008 with 92% retention. Results: Onset of alcohol use before age 11 (late childhood), when compared with initiation during early adolescence, was related to an increased chronicity of adult alcohol dependence, even after accounting for sociodemographic controls and other substance use in adolescence. The present study finds no evidence that early adolescence is a particularly sensitive period for the onset of alcohol use. Findings related to the onset of regular alcohol use and the chronicity of alcohol dependence suggest that the onset of regular drinking before age 21 is problematic, but no one adolescent period is more sensitive than others. Specifically, although all age groups that started drinking regularly before age 21 had a greater rate of alcohol dependence in adulthood, initiation of regular use of alcohol at or before age 14 was not related to greater chronicity of alcohol dependence than the initiation of regular use of alcohol in middle or late adolescence. Conclusions: The findings suggest the importance of delaying the onset of alcohol use through prevention efforts as early as the elementary grades. In addition, prevention efforts should focus on preventing the onset of regular drinking before age 21. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 221-231, 2011)},

OBJECTIVE To test whether the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention system reduced levels of risk and adolescent problem behaviors community wide 8 years after implementation of CTC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A community-randomized trial was performed in 24 small towns in 7 states, matched within state, assigned randomly to a control or intervention group in 2003. All fifth-grade students attending public schools in study communities in 2003-2004 who received consent from their parents to participate (76.4% of the eligible population) were included. A panel of 4407 fifth graders was surveyed through 12th grade, with 92.5% of the sample participating at the last follow-up. INTERVENTIONS A coalition of community stakeholders received training and technical assistance to install CTC, used epidemiologic data to identify elevated risk factors and depressed protective factors for adolescent problem behaviors in the community, and implemented tested and effective programs for youths aged 10 to 14 years as well as their families and schools to address their community’s elevated risks.

95% CI, 1.09-1.58), smoking cigarettes (ARR = 1.13
95% CI, 1.01-1.27), and engaging in delinquency (ARR = 1.18
95% CI, 1.03-1.36). They were also less likely to ever have committed a violent act (ARR = 0.86
95% CI, 0.76-0.98). There were no significant differences by intervention group in targeted risks, the prevalence of past-month or past-year substance use, or past-year delinquency or violence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using the CTC system continued to prevent the initiation of adolescent problem behaviors through 12th grade, 8 years after implementation of CTC and 3 years after study-provided resources ended, but did not produce reductions in current levels of risk or current prevalence of problem behavior in 12th grade.

Roadway travel distance from each census unit to the nearest alcohol outlet was summarised according to socioeconomic deprivation for each area. Analyses were conducted by license type (pubs/bars, clubs, restaurants, off-licenses) and community urban–rural status. Strong associations were found between proximity to the nearest alcohol outlet and deprivation, there being greater access to outlets in more-deprived urban areas.},

Also of interest was whether associations remain after statistically controlling for other factors known to predict school outcomes. METHODS State‐representative student samples were surveyed in 2002 (grade 7
N = 1858) and followed up annually to 2004 (grade 9) in both sites. Students completed a modified version of the Communities That Care survey to report alcohol use, school outcomes, and risk and protective factors. Response rates were above 74% and retention rates exceeded 98% in both places. RESULTS Controlling for grade 7 risk factors, grade 7 current alcohol use, and heavy episodic drinking were associated with grade 8 school suspension. Grade 7 current and frequent alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking were linked to grade 9 truancy. In fully adjusted analyses, associations between early alcohol use and academic failure and low school commitment did not remain. CONCLUSIONS Although alcohol use is one factor influencing school performance and connection, there are other risk factors that need to be targeted to improve school outcomes.},

This paper aims to evaluate existing parent based alcohol education programs with a focus on understanding parent specific outcomes including parental attitudes, parent-child communication, alcohol specific rule setting and parental monitoring
study quality, the extent of stakeholder engagement in program design and the level of theory application. Method A systematic review of electronic databases EBSCO, Emerald, ProQuest, PubMed, Ovid, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis and Web of Science was conducted from database inception to August 2019. A total of 4288 unique records were retrieved from the eight databases. Studies were included if they evaluated school based alcohol education programs that included a parent component and detailed outcome measures associated with parent data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Results In total 17 studies qualified for assessment, detailing 13 individual parent programs. Of these, ten programs demonstrated positive effects in at least one parent reported outcome measure. Stakeholder engagement during the design of programs was lacking with the majority of programs. One third of the programs did not report theory use and when theory was used reporting was weak with three programs applying theory, five testing theory and none building theory. According to the EPHPP tool, overall ten programs were rated as weak, three as moderate and none as strong. Conclusion Future studies are recommended to further enhance the effectiveness of parental programs by improving study quality, increasing stakeholder engagement and increasing the level of theory application and reporting.},

Participants Individuals (aged 21–93 years) who participated in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991–93 (n = 8758). Measurements The primary outcome was first registration with AUD during follow‐up (n = 249). AUD was identified in the Danish National Patient Register, in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and in an outpatient treatment register. Major life events were assessed by a questionnaire in the Copenhagen City Heart study. Data were analysed by Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, educational level, household income, cohabitation status and psychiatric comorbidity. Findings Serious family conflicts in childhood [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35
95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00, 1.83] and serious economic problems in adult life (HR = 2.22
95% CI = 1.64, 3.01) were associated significantly with increased risk of AUD. Prospective analyses did not show consistent effects of accumulation of major life events in childhood or adult life, but an additional analysis based on all AUD registrations suggested an association between accumulated childhood events and risk of AUD. Conclusions Serious economic problems in adult life are associated strongly with risk of alcohol use disorders, and there may be an influence of accumulated childhood events on risk of alcohol use disorders.},

Design  Data were part of a longitudinal study of alcohol use among multi-ethnic urban young adolescents who were assigned randomly to the control group of a prevention trial. Setting  Data were collected from a cohort of youth, and their parents, who attended public schools in Chicago, Illinois (2002-2005). Participants  The sample comprised the 1388 students, and their parents, who had been assigned randomly to the control group and were present and completed surveys at baseline, in the beginning of 6th grade (age 12). The sample was primarily low-income, and African American and Hispanic. Measurements  Students completed self-report questionnaires when in the 6th, 7th and 8th grades (age 12-14 years
response rates 91-96%). Parents of the 6th grade students also completed questionnaires (70% response rate). Findings  Student report, at age 12, of parental provision of alcohol and home alcohol availability, and parental report of providing alcohol to their child and the accessibility of alcohol in the home, were associated with significant increases in the trajectories of young adolescent alcohol use and intentions from ages 12-14 years. Student report of receiving alcohol from their parent or taking it from home during their last drinking occasion were the most robust predictors of increases in alcohol use and intentions over time. Conclusions  Results indicate that it is risky for parents to allow children to drink during early adolescence. When these findings are considered together with the risks associated with early onset of alcohol use, it is clear that parents can play an important role in prevention.},

Neuroimaging studies can be used to measure structural and functional developments in the brain that mediate the relationship between psychopathology and SUD in adolescence. Externalizing disorders and SUD are both associated with structural and functional changes in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex in adolescence. The neural mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders and SUD are less clear, but evidence points to involvement of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. We also highlight independent contributions of SUD, which may vary in certain ways by the substances assessed.

   abstract = {Background: The hazardous effects of alcohol consumption on both the hippocampus and memory have been well established. However, the longitudinal effects of ethanol on the developing brain and related consequences on memory are not well explored. Given the above, we investigated the longitudinal effects of college drinking on hippocampal volume in emerging college adults. Methods: Data were derived from the longitudinal Brain and Alcohol Research with College Students study. A subset of 146 freshmen (mean age at baseline = 18.5 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and 24 months later. Four drinking-related measures derived from monthly surveys were reduced to a single alcohol use index using principal component analysis. Gray matter volumetric change (GMV-c) data were derived using a longitudinal pipeline. Voxelwise hippocampal/para-hippocampal GMV-c associations with the drinking index were derived using a multiple regression framework within SPM12. Supplementary associations were assessed between GMV-c and memory scores computed from the California Verbal Learning Test–II (assessed at the end of the study), and between GMV-c and total alcohol-induced memory blackouts. Results: Larger alcohol use index was associated with an accelerated GMV decline in the hippocampus/para-hippocampus. Also, larger hippocampal volume decline was associated with poorer memory performance and more memory blackouts. Conclusions: Our study extends prior cross-sectional literature by showing that a heavier drinking burden while in college is associated with greater hippocampal GMV decline that is in turn associated with poorer memory scores, all of which could ultimately have a significant impact on student success.},

Many are hesitant to adopt prevention curricula that are not focused directly on academic achievement. Yet, some have hypothesized that prevention curricula can remove barriers to learning and, thus, promote achievement. We examined relationships among school levels of student substance use and risk and protective factors that predict adolescent problem behaviors and achievement test performance. Hierarchical generalized linear models were used to predict associations involving school-averaged levels of substance use and risk and protective factors and students' likelihood of meeting achievement test standards on the Washington Assessment of Student Learning, statistically controlling for demographic and economic factors known to be associated with achievement. Levels of substance use and risk/protective factors predicted the academic test score performance of students. Many of these effects remained significant even after controlling for model covariates. Implementing prevention programs that target empirically identified risk and protective factors has the potential to have a favorable effect on students' academic achievement.},

   abstract = {Alcohol outlets have been associated with various forms of injury and may contribute to neighborhood disparities in drug overdose. Few studies have examined the associations between alcohol outlets and drug overdose. This study investigated whether alcohol outlets were associated with the neighborhood drug overdose rate and whether the sale of drug paraphernalia contributes to this association. A cross-sectional ecological spatial analysis was conducted within census block groups in Baltimore City (n = 653). Outcomes were counts of EMS calls for any drug overdose in 2015 (n = 3,856). Exposures of interest were counts of alcohol outlets licensed for off-premise and on-premise consumption and the proportion of off-premise outlets selling drug paraphernalia (e.g., blunt wrappers, baggies, pipes). Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relationship between outlet count and overdose rate, and if paraphernalia sales altered this relationship, controlling for other neighborhood factors. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed and regression inference adjusted accordingly. Each additional off-premise alcohol outlet was associated with a 16.6% increase in the neighborhood overdose rate (IRR=1.17, 95%CI=(1.11, 1.23)), adjusted for other neighborhood variables. On-premise alcohol outlets were not significantly associated with overdose rate when adjusting for off-premise alcohol outlets (IRR=1.01, 95% CI=(0.97, 1.06)). The proportion of off-premise outlets that sold drug paraphernalia was negatively associated with overdose rate (IRR=0.55, 95% CI=(0.41, 0.74)) and did not alter the relationship between off-premise outlets and overdose. This study provides preliminary public health evidence for informing policy decisions about alcohol outlet licensing and zoning. Alcohol outlets could be potential community partners for harm reduction strategies such as health communication in identifying overdose symptoms or Good Samaritan Laws.},

We hypothesise that in order to be effective, programmes have to be aligned with the developmental stages of the intended target group (childhood, early, middle, or late adolescence). The present study provides an overview of universal and targeted programmes, while distinguishing four age groups and examining which intervention characteristics are the effective components for the respective groups. Databases were searched for controlled studies of school-based programmes, evaluating their effectiveness on either smoking, alcohol or drug use. Multivariate meta-regression analysis was used to analyse the associations between effects and programme characteristics. Our meta-analysis evaluates 288 programmes with a total of 436,180 participants. The findings support our hypothesis that specific aspects of the school-based programmes are effective in some developmental stages, but not for other age groups. The differences in effectiveness are systematically related to psychological and cognitive needs and capacities. Our findings highlight the importance of considering a developmental perspective when designing and offering school-based prevention programmes. The various developmental stages offer different possibilities and opportunities for the reduction and prevention of substance use. •All developmental periods offer different possibilities for prevention.•Elementary school students benefit most from enhancing personal competencies.•Targeting social norms is beneficial for early adolescents.•In middle adolescence, universal programmes are not very effective.•During late adolescence, opportunities for substance use prevention increase.},

These analyses have found that although alcohol use among these age groups overall has been declining since 1975, levels remain high. Thus, in 2011 about one-quarter of 8th graders, one-half of 10th graders, and almost two-thirds of 12th graders reported drinking alcohol in the month preceding the interview. Binge drinking (i.e., consumption of five or more drinks in a row) was also prevalent. Specific rates of drinking, binge drinking, and getting drunk varied among different student subgroups based on gender and race/ethnicity. The MTF study has also identified numerous factors that influence the risk of alcohol use among adolescents, including parents and peers, school and work, religiosity and community attachment, exercise and sports participation, externalizing behavior and other drug use, risk taking and sensation seeking, well-being, and drinking attitudes and reasons for alcohol use.

This review updates knowledge on risk relations between dimensions of alcohol use and health outcomes to be used in global and national Comparative Risk Assessments (CRAs). Methods Systematic review of reviews and meta‐analyses on alcohol consumption and health outcomes attributable to alcohol use. For dimensions of exposure: volume of alcohol use, blood alcohol concentration and patterns of drinking, in particular heavy drinking occasions were studied. For liver cirrhosis, quality of alcohol was additionally considered. For all outcomes (mortality and/or morbidity): cause of death and disease/injury categories based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes used in global CRAs
harm to others. Results In total, 255 reviews and meta‐analyses were identified. Alcohol use was found to be linked causally to many disease and injury categories, with more than 40 ICD‐10 three‐digit categories being fully attributable to alcohol. Most partially attributable disease categories showed monotonic relationships with volume of alcohol use: the more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk of disease or death. Exceptions were ischaemic diseases and diabetes, with curvilinear relationships, and with beneficial effects of light to moderate drinking in people without heavy irregular drinking occasions. Biological pathways suggest an impact of heavy drinking occasions on additional diseases
however, the lack of medical epidemiological studies measuring this dimension of alcohol use precluded an in‐depth analysis. For injuries, except suicide, blood alcohol concentration was the most important dimension of alcohol use. Alcohol use caused marked harm to others, which has not yet been researched sufficiently. Conclusions Research since 2010 confirms the importance of alcohol use as a risk factor for disease and injuries
for some health outcomes, more than one dimension of use needs to be considered. Epidemiological studies should include measurement of heavy drinking occasions in line with biological knowledge.},

While research has focused on how individual differences contribute to recanting, intra-individual factors associated with recanting over time remain understudied. Adolescents (n = 1023) were assessed six times between 2009 – 2015. The sample included participants who reported ever-sipping alcohol in at least one assessment who maintained or recanted ever-sipping at the subsequent assessment (n = 543, 53.1% of full sample
54.5% female
84.9% white
89.5% non-Hispanic). The majority (58.6%) of the sample recanted ever-sipping. We fit linear mixed models to investigate whether prospective changes in perceived peer drinking, peer approval, alcohol expectancies, and fear of reprisal predicted recanting. To explore whether mechanisms of recanting differed for delayed (i.e., two assessments or later) recanting, we refit the models in a subset of data excluding immediate (i.e., subsequent assessment) recanters. Prospective increases in perceived peer drinking (OR = 0.65), peer approval of drinking (OR = 0.82), and positive and negative alcohol expectancies (OR = 0.96
0.98, respectively) predicted lower odds of recanting. Similar effects were observed among only delayed recanters. Time-varying, intra-individual factors uniquely predicted recanting over time. Although most recanting occurs immediately following the initial report of ever-sipping, the observed effects were consistent between delayed recanters and the sample as a whole. Considering the systematic patterns evident in recanting, researchers should consider using computer-assisted or other research methods that minimize or verify recanting when it occurs while also informing missing data models.},

The systematic review aimed to analyze psychometric validations and cross-cultural adaptation processes of CTCYS to prepare its Brazilian validation. PubMed, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Web of Science were the databases included. The study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Twenty articles were selected based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In general, the construct validity indexes were considered adequate, and the measures of risk and protective factors were equivalent between ethnic groups, gender, and populations at risk. Reliability values for most scales are good, averaging about 0.78. We found cultural adaptations from six different countries with some satisfactory results, but not so good as the original properties of CTCYS and the adjustments to other ethnic groups or subpopulations in the United States. This survey may be a potentially reliable and valid instrument to assess risk and protection in different cultures and populations. However, there is still a gap in the instrument's cross-cultural adaptation processes.},

   abstract = {Objective: A major challenge for health psychologists is to ensure the implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve population health. To reduce high rates of adolescent alcohol use and related health problems, trials of the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention process were implemented in Australia beginning in 2001. The process assists communities to strategically plan and monitor implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions. This article reports an evaluation of the effects in the first four Australian communities that completed the process. Method: Trends were examined based on self-report surveys completed by 41,328 adolescents (average age 13.5 years, 51.7% female) across 109 municipal localities between 1999 and 2015. Multilevel modeling compared the 5 localities where the 4 coalitions completed the CTC process with the remaining 104 localities for trends in adolescent reports of lifetime alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and past year antisocial behavior. Results: Relative to Australian trends, adolescents in CTC localities reported significantly steeper annual reductions in any lifetime alcohol (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.94, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = [0.93, 0.95]), tobacco (AOR = 0.97, CI [0.96, 0.99]), cannabis use (AOR = 0.96, CI [0.93, 0.98]) and antisocial behavior (unstandardized regression coefficient [B] = −0.001, CI [−0.002, 0.000]). Conclusion: Implementation of the CTC process in Australia was associated with more rapid community reductions in adolescent health behavior problems. Supporting community coalitions to adopt evidence-based interventions appears a feasible means for health psychologists to improve the health of large adolescent populations and prevent related chronic health problems in later life.},

   abstract = {Alcohol outlet clusters are an important social determinant of health in cities, but little is known about the populations exposed to them. If outlets cluster in neighborhoods comprised of specific racial/ethnic or economic groups, then they may function as a root cause of urban health disparities. This study used 2016 liquor license data (n = 1204) from Baltimore City, Maryland, and demographic data from the American Community Survey. We defined alcohol outlet clusters by combining SaTScan moving window methods and distances between outlets. We used multiple logistic regression to compare census block groups (CBGs) ( n = 537) inside and outside of four types of outlet clusters: total, on-premise, off-premise, and LBD-7 (combined on-/off-premise). The most robust predictor of alcohol outlet cluster membership was a history of redlining, i.e., racially discriminatory lending policies. CBGs that were redlined had 7.32 times the odds of being in an off-premise cluster, 8.07 times the odds of being in an on-premise cluster, and 8.60 times the odds of being in a LBD-7 cluster. In addition, level of economic investment (marked by vacant properties) appears to be a key characteristic that separates CBGs in on-and off-premise outlet clusters. CBGs with racial/ethnic or socioeconomic advantage had higher odds of being in on-premise clusters and CBGs marked by disinvestment had higher odds of being in off-premise clusters. Off-premise clusters deserve closer examination from a policy perspective, to mitigate their potential role in creating and perpetuating social and health disparities. In addition to addressing redlining and disinvestment, the current negative effects of alcohol outlet clusters that have grown up in redlined and disinvested areas must be addressed if inequities in these neighborhoods are to be reversed.},

(b) What is the relationship between community leader ratings of the community and student perceptions of their community?
and (c) How are community leader ratings and student perceptions of the community related to community levels of current student substance use and serious delinquency? Results indicate that community leaders' perceptions of community risk factors demonstrate both internal validity and criterion validity. Community leaders and students demonstrate modest agreement in assessments of community risk factors. Community leaders' ratings of community norms favorable to substance use and community law enforcement permissive of substance use were related to levels of substance use reported by students.

These include studies showing that alcohol's reinforcing effects may result not only from its enhancement of dopaminergic, GABAergic and opioid signaling but also from its caloric properties. Studies in those suffering from an AUD have revealed significant alterations in dopamine (DA), GABA, cannabinoids, opioid and serotonin neurotransmission and in brain energy utilization (glucose and acetate metabolism) that are likely to contribute to compulsive alcohol taking, dysphoria/depression, and to alcohol-associated neurotoxicity. Studies have also evaluated the effects of abstinence on recovery of brain metabolism and neurotransmitter function and the potential value of some of these measures to predict clinical outcomes. Finally, PET studies have started to provide insights about the neuronal mechanisms by which certain genes contribute to the vulnerability to AUD. These findings have helped identify new strategies for prevention and treatment of AUD. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled “Alcoholism”. •Calories in alcohol might contribute to its rewarding effects.•Alcohol abuse increases reliance on acetate as an energy source in the brain.•Loss of control in AUD is associated with reduced striatal D2 receptor signaling.•Enhanced striatal D2 receptor signaling is protective to those vulnerable to AUD.•Chronic alcohol reduces μ opioid and CB1 receptors and GABAergic signaling in brain.},

   abstract = {Behaviours such as eating, copulating, defending oneself or taking addictive drugs begin with a motivation to initiate the behaviour. Both this motivational drive and the behaviours that follow are influenced by past and present experience with the reinforcing stimuli (such as drugs or energy-rich foods) that increase the likelihood and/or strength of the behavioural response (such as drug taking or overeating). At a cellular and circuit level, motivational drive is dependent on the concentration of extrasynaptic dopamine present in specific brain areas such as the striatum. Cues that predict a reinforcing stimulus also modulate extrasynaptic dopamine concentrations, energizing motivation. Repeated administration of the reinforcer (drugs, energy-rich foods) generates conditioned associations between the reinforcer and the predicting cues, which is accompanied by downregulated dopaminergic response to other incentives and downregulated capacity for top-down self-regulation, facilitating the emergence of impulsive and compulsive responses to food or drug cues. Thus, dopamine contributes to addiction and obesity through its differentiated roles in reinforcement, motivation and self-regulation, referred to here as the 'dopamine motive system', which, if compromised, can result in increased, habitual and inflexible responding. Thus, interventions to rebalance the dopamine motive system might have therapeutic potential for obesity and addiction.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This paper describes the origins and application of a theory, the social development model ({SDM}), that seeks to explain causal processes that lead to the development of prosocial and problem behaviors. The {SDM} was used to guide the development of a multicomponent intervention in middle childhood called Raising Healthy Children ({RHC}) that seeks to promote prosocial development and prevent problem behaviors. This paper reviews and integrates the tests of the {SDM} and the impact of {RHC}. While the original results of both model and intervention tests have been published elsewhere, this paper provides a comprehensive review of these tests. As such, this integrative paper provides one of the few examples of the power of theory-driven developmental preventive intervention to understand impact across generations and the power of embedding controlled tests of preventive intervention within longitudinal studies to understand causal mechanisms.
Methods
Application of the {SDM} in the {RHC} intervention was tested in a quasi-experimental trial nested in the Seattle Social Development Project ({SSDP}). {SSDP} is a longitudinal study of 808 students who attended 18 public schools in Seattle, {WA}, and whose parents consented for their participation in longitudinal research when they were in grade 5 (77\% of the eligible population in participating schools). Students assented at each survey administration and consented to longitudinal follow-up when they turned 18. Panel subjects were followed and surveyed 15 times from grade 5 through age 39, with most completion rates above 90\%.
Results
We describe effects of the full multicomponent {RHC} intervention delivered in grades 1 through 6 by comparing outcomes of those children assigned to the full {RHC} intervention condition to controls from middle childhood through age 39. We also report the effects of the full {RHC} intervention on the firstborn children of participants compared with the firstborn children of controls.
Conclusions
We discuss the use of the theory to guide the development and testing of preventive interventions and the utility of nesting intervention tests within longitudinal studies for testing both theory and interventions.},

abstract = {Community coalitions are a popular strategy to coordinate activities and resources to prevent adolescent substance use and delinquent behavior. Despite early evidence of their lack of effectiveness, a new generation of community coalitions has shown positive results in preventing youth substance use and delinquency. This success can be attributed to coalition decision making focused on reducing local risk factors and increasing local protective factors through the use of evidence-based prevention programs. A previous study using cross-sectional data established cut point values for scales measuring risk and protective factors on the Communities That Care Youth Survey (CTCYS) to identify high levels of risk and low levels of protection in communities on each scale. The current study extended this previous research by using longitudinal data to assess the validity of risk and protective factor cut point values in predicting substance use and delinquent behavior 1 year after risk and protection were measured. The findings demonstrate the predictive validity of cut points for risk and protective factor scales measured by the CTCYS and suggest their utility in guiding prevention efforts.},
