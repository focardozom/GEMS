# Research question

Does the GEMS program (*intervention*) increase the parent's ability to provide opportunities for pro-social involvement of adolescents in family activities (*primary outcome*) and decrease the report of initiation of alcohol use in the adolescents (*secondary outcome*) in families with adolescents between (8-14 years) (*Population*), more than the parents who participate only in the regular school's programs for parenting (*Control*)?

# Research Hypothesis

**Primary outcome:** ability to provide opportunities

*Null*: on average, parents who received the program will have the same ability to provide opportunities for pro-social involvement of the adolescents in the family. 

*Alternative*: on average, parents who received the program will have more ability to provide opportunities for pro-social involvement of the adolescents in the family. 

**Secondary outcome:** decrease in the early initiation of alcohol use. 

*Null:* on average, adolescents in families who received the program will tend to have the same age of alcohol initiation than the adolescents of families who received the school services.  

*Alternative:* on average, adolescents in families who received the program will tend to have a higher age of alcohol initiation compared to adolescents of families who received the school services.


# Trial design

Phase II Simple randomization prevention trial. 

Unit of randomization: classrooms. 

Control group: parents who participate in the school parenting services. 
Experimental group: Parents who receive the GEMS program. 

*Inclusion Criteria:*

By parents, we mean caregivers:
Father, mother, older brothers, uncles, health professional, grand parents, or other adults who are the legals responsible for the adolescents wellness. 

Colombian families. 

Parents of adolescents registered on the classroom. Given that we will use the students lists 

Adolescents between 10-14 years old.

Families with access to a cellphone, tablet or laptop (no internet needed)

Exclusion:

Caregivers from different schools. 

Cargivers with adolescentes less than 8 years old or more than 12 years at the start of the program. 


## Measures

Primary outcome:

Parents ability to provide opportunities to pro-social involvement in the family. 

Instrument.
Communities that Care Youth Survey:

This instrument assesses risk factors and protective factors critical topreventing substance abuse (@Glaser2005) . We will adapt 6 questions to evaluate parents ability to provide oportunities to prosocial involvement in the family. Previous analysis (in-process) has shown equivalence between students and parents respond to questions regarding family and comunitary risk and protective factors (*r*=0.6).

## Public Health relevance

## Why is important to prevent alcohol use in adolescents?

Alcohol use in adolescentes  is associated with structural and functional changes in the brain, such as impaired basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex development [@Kroll2020]. Also, it has been associated with negative social behaviors like episodes of verbal aggression, academic difficulties, loss of employment, and unintentional injury [@brown2008; @Meda2018; @Michael2015]. Given this evidence, the prevention of alcohol is crucial. 

## How to prevent alcohol use:

The standard approach to understanding alcohol use in youth is to analyze risk and protective factors [@Haggerty2013]. A risk factor is defined as characteristics from the individual, environment, or social context that increase the probability of using alcohol [@Sloboda2012]. According to this framework, individuals may be influenced environmental characteristics that increase the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder.

# I

## Intervention 

*GEMS, strategies for better parenting*. 

### What is GEMS?

GEMS is a prevention program that provides strategies to parents with children between 10 - 14 years to avoid alcohol use in adolescents. 

GEMS is a self-guided intervention delivered via e-health/technology, supported by an implementation team of three trained professionals. The team is conformed by a coordinator in charge of recruitment and organizing the implementation. A psychologist to assists the parents and provides feedback on the program activities. Finally, a data scientist in charge of conducting the quantitative evaluations monitor the implementation and resolves technical issues during the program's implementation.
